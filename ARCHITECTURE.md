# Architecture Documentation 

This document describes the technical architecture of the NeuroWealth Vault contract, including storage layout, data structures, and integration patterns.

## Overview

The NeuroWealth Vault is a Soroban smart contract that implements a non-custodial yield vault on the Stellar blockchain. Users deposit USDC, and an AI agent automatically deploys those funds across various yield-generating protocols.

## Storage Layout

### Instance Storage

Instance storage is used for contract-wide configuration that is read frequently but changes infrequently.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `Agent` | Address | Authorized AI agent that can call rebalance() |
| `UsdcToken` | Address | USDC token contract address |
| `TotalDeposits` | i128 | Total USDC principal deposited (excluding yield) |
| `TotalShares` | i128 | Total vault shares in circulation |
| `TotalAssets` | i128 | Total managed assets (principal + yield) |
| `CurrentProtocol`| Symbol | Active protocol symbol ("blend", "dex", "none") |
| `BlendPool` | Address | Blend pool contract address |
| `DexPool` | Address | DEX liquidity pool contract address (Issue #228) |
| `Paused` | bool | Emergency pause state |
| `Owner` | Address | Contract owner for administrative functions |
| `PendingOwner` | Address | Pending owner for two-step transfer |
| `TvLCap` | i128 | Maximum total value locked |
| `UserDepositCap` | i128 | Maximum deposit per user |
| `ApprovalTtl` | u32 | Shared ledger TTL used for Blend and DEX approvals (authoritative; `BlendApprovalTtl` retained for legacy fallback) |
| `MinDeposit` | i128 | Minimum per-transaction deposit |
| `MaxDeposit` | i128 | Maximum per-transaction deposit |
| `MinRebalanceInterval` | u32 | Minimum ledgers between `rebalance()` calls; key absent = no cooldown (Issue #59) |
| `LastRebalanceLedger` | u32 | Ledger of the most recent successful `rebalance()` (Issue #59) |
| `PendingAgent` | Address | Agent awaiting timelock confirmation (Issue #317) |
| `AgentTimelockExpiry` | u32 | Ledger at which the pending agent update becomes confirmable (Issue #317) |
| `PendingUpgradeHash` | BytesN<32> | WASM hash awaiting timelock execution (Issue #316) |
| `UpgradeTimelockExpiry` | u32 | Ledger at which the pending upgrade becomes executable (Issue #316) |
| `Version` | u32 | Contract version for upgrade tracking |

### Persistent Storage

Persistent storage is used for per-user data that requires efficient access.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `Balance(Address)` | i128 | Deprecated. Retained only to preserve the serialized `DataKey` layout across upgrades; no longer read or written |
| `Shares(Address)` | i128 | User's share balance (proportional ownership) |
| `UserStrategy(Address)` | Symbol | Per-user strategy preference ("conservative", "balanced", "growth") |

## Persistent Storage TTL Policy

Soroban persistent entries require rent (TTL). Expired `Shares` entries can be
archived and must be restored before use.

### Read-only getters (no TTL writes)

`get_balance` and `get_shares` only read storage. They do **not** call
`extend_ttl`, so RPC/indexer polling does not pay write costs or mutate ledger
state during simulation.

Implications for indexers and dashboards:

- High-frequency balance polling is safe and side-effect free.
- TTL for inactive users is **not** refreshed by read-only getters.
- Use `touch_user_ttl(user)` in a scheduled maintenance transaction when a user
  still has (or had) shares and you need to extend the `Shares` entry TTL without
  depositing or withdrawing.

### Explicit TTL maintenance

`touch_user_ttl(user)` extends the `Shares(user)` persistent entry when it
exists, using threshold **100** ledgers and extend-to **100** ledgers (same
parameters previously applied inside the read getters).

Returns `false` when no `Shares` entry exists (never deposited, or entry already
expired and removed).

### State-changing paths

`deposit`, `withdraw`, and `withdraw_all` update `Shares(user)` via `set`, which
refreshes TTL as part of normal writes. Routine user activity keeps share data
alive without calling `touch_user_ttl`.

## DataKey Structure

```rust
pub enum DataKey {
    Balance(Address),      // user -> usdc principal
    Shares(Address),       // user -> share balance
    TotalDeposits,        // total principal in vault
    TotalShares,          // total shares in circulation
    TotalAssets,          // total managed assets (principal + yield)
    Agent,                // authorized AI agent address
    UsdcToken,            // USDC token contract address
    Paused,               // emergency pause state
    Owner,                // contract owner address
    PendingOwner,         // pending owner for two-step transfer
    TvLCap,               // maximum TVL
    UserDepositCap,       // per-user deposit limit
    ApprovalTtl,          // shared protocol approval lifetime
    MinDeposit,           // minimum transaction amount
    MaxDeposit,           // maximum transaction amount
    Version,              // contract version
    BlendPool,            // Blend pool contract address
    DexPool,              // DEX liquidity pool contract address (#228)
    CurrentProtocol,      // symbol of active protocol ("blend" | "dex" | "none")
    UserStrategy(Address),// user -> strategy preference symbol
    MinRebalanceInterval, // rebalance cooldown in ledgers (#59)
    LastRebalanceLedger,  // ledger of last successful rebalance (#59)
    PendingAgent,         // agent awaiting timelock confirmation (#317)
    AgentTimelockExpiry,  // ledger the pending agent update unlocks at (#317)
    PendingUpgradeHash,   // WASM hash awaiting timelock execution (#316)
    UpgradeTimelockExpiry,// ledger the pending upgrade unlocks at (#316)
    Deployer,             // deployer address (init only)
}
```

## Share Accounting Model

The vault uses a share-based accounting model compatible with the ERC-4626 standard. Each depositor receives vault shares proportional to their contribution at the time of deposit. As yield accrues and `TotalAssets` grows relative to `TotalShares`, each share appreciates in value — meaning later redeemers receive more USDC per share than they originally paid.

### Share Pricing

```
exchange_rate = TotalAssets / TotalShares          (assets per share)

shares_minted = (deposit_amount × TotalShares) / TotalAssets
assets_out    = (shares_burned × TotalAssets)  / TotalShares
```

The on-chain getter `get_exchange_rate()` returns `TotalAssets × 10_000_000 / TotalShares` (7-decimal fixed-point) to avoid fractional values.

### Yield Accrual via update_total_assets

The AI agent calls `update_total_assets(new_total)` to report yield earned in external protocols (e.g. Blend). This increases `TotalAssets` without changing `TotalShares`, which raises the share price for all holders. The update is bounded: a single call cannot decrease `TotalAssets` below the current value, and cannot increase it beyond a configurable maximum basis-point delta, preventing the agent from inflating balances arbitrarily.

### Blend Deployment

When the agent calls `rebalance(protocol="blend", ...)` the vault:

1. Approves the Blend pool to pull vault USDC (short-lived TTL approval stored in the shared `ApprovalTtl` key).
2. Calls `blend_pool.submit_with_allowance()` to supply USDC as a lender.
3. Records `CurrentProtocol = "blend"`.

On withdrawal, if the vault's idle balance is insufficient, it calls `blend_pool.submit()` to withdraw the required amount before transferring to the user.

### Historical: Phase 1 (1:1 accounting — deprecated)

Prior to the ERC-4626 model, the vault used simple 1:1 balance accounting: 1 deposited USDC = 1 vault balance unit, with no share concept. This approach could not track proportional yield and has been fully replaced. The `Balance(Address)` key is retained only for legacy migration paths and is no longer the authoritative ownership record — `Shares(Address)` is.

### Current Implementation (Share-Based)

The vault converts between USDC assets and vault shares using the current exchange rate:

```
shares = (assets * total_shares) / total_assets
assets = (shares * total_assets) / total_shares
```

**Key Features**:
- **Proportional Yield**: Users benefit from yield accrual as the `TotalAssets` increases relative to `TotalShares`.
- **Atomic Conversions**: Deposits mint shares and withdrawals burn shares based on the real-time asset/share ratio.
- **ERC-4626 Compatibility**: Implements standard preview and conversion functions.

## Rounding Rules

To protect the vault's solvency and prevent "dust" attacks, rounding rules are strictly applied:

- **Deposits**: 
    - `preview_deposit_to_shares`: Rounds **down** (user may receive slightly fewer shares).
- **Withdrawals**:
    - `withdraw(assets)`: Rounds **up** when calculating shares to burn (user burns slightly more shares to cover the asset amount).
    - `preview_withdraw(assets)`: Rounds **up** to match actual behavior.
- **Conversions**:
    - `convert_to_assets`: Rounds **down**.
    - `convert_to_shares`: Rounds **down**.

}
```

**Topics**: `SymbolShort("caps_upd")`

## Cross-Contract Integration Flow

### USDC Token Integration

```
Vault Contract → USDC Token Contract (via token::Client)
                  ↑
                  ├── transfer() - receive user funds
                  └── transfer() - return funds to user
```

**Integration Points**:
1. `deposit()`: Calls `token.transfer(user, vault, amount)`
2. `withdraw()`: Calls `token.transfer(vault, user, amount)`

**Assumptions**:
- USDC uses Stellar's Soroban Token interface
- 7 decimal places
- Standard token operations (transfer, balance, etc.)

### AI Agent Integration

```
AI Agent → Vault Contract
           ├── get_balance(user) - monitor positions (read-only, no TTL write)
           ├── get_shares(user) - monitor share balances (read-only)
           ├── touch_user_ttl(user) - optional TTL maintenance for idle users
           ├── get_total_deposits() - monitor TVL
           └── rebalance(strategy) - signal strategy changes
           ↓
     DepositEvent / WithdrawEvent (via Soroban events)
```

**Event Flow**:
1. User calls `deposit()` or `withdraw()`
2. Contract emits corresponding event
3. AI agent monitors events via RPC/subscription
4. Agent responds by calling `rebalance()` or adjusting off-chain state

### Blend Protocol Integration

```
Vault Contract → Blend Protocol Contract
                 ↑
                 ├── submit_with_allowance() - lend USDC for yield
                 ├── submit() - withdraw from lending
                 └── balance() - check yield earned
```

The vault integrates with the Blend protocol to generate yield on deposited USDC. The AI agent triggers rebalancing to move funds into or out of Blend.

### DEX Liquidity Pool Integration (Issue #228)

```
Vault Contract → DEX Liquidity Pool Contract
                 ↑
                 ├── add_liquidity(from, asset, amount, min_out)    - provide USDC liquidity
                 ├── remove_liquidity(to, asset, amount, min_out)   - withdraw liquidity
                 └── balance(asset, user)                           - current position size
```

Alongside Blend lending, the vault can deploy idle USDC as single-asset
liquidity into a Stellar DEX pool. This backs the Balanced and Growth
strategies described in the README. The two integrations are mutually exclusive
at any point in time: `CurrentProtocol` names at most one of `"blend"`,
`"dex"`, or `"none"`.

See [`docs/DEX_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/DEX_INTEGRATION.md) for the full interface
research and rationale.

#### Storage

| Key | Storage | Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|-------------|
| `DataKey::DexPool` | Instance | Address | DEX liquidity pool contract address. Absent until `set_dex_pool` is called; any rebalance targeting `"dex"` panics with `DexPoolNotConfigured` while unset. |
| `DataKey::CurrentProtocol` | Instance | Symbol | Set to `"dex"` once a supply leg succeeds. Shared with the Blend path — the vault is never deployed to both at once. |
| `DataKey::ApprovalTtl` | Instance | u32 | Shared with Blend. Each supply leg approves the DEX pool to spend USDC until `current_ledger + ApprovalTtl`. |

`set_dex_pool(owner, pool_address)` is owner-only and probes the candidate
pool's `balance` entrypoint before storing the address, so a wrong or
non-conforming address is rejected at configuration time rather than at the
next rebalance. It initializes `CurrentProtocol` to `"none"` when unset and
emits `DexPoolConfiguredEvent`. There is no separate `DexApprovalTtl` key:
`set_approval_ttl` governs both integrations.

#### DexPoolClient interface

`DexPoolClient` is an internal adapter mirroring `BlendPoolClient`. It treats
the pool as a single-asset venue and derives actual amounts from the **vault's
own USDC balance delta** rather than trusting the pool's return value, so
partial fills and slippage are observable on-chain.

| Method | Pool call | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `supply(pool, asset, amount, min_out, to)` | `add_liquidity(from, asset, amount, min_out)` | `balance_before - balance_after` (USDC actually supplied) |
| `withdraw(pool, asset, amount, min_out, to)` | `remove_liquidity(to, asset, amount, min_out)` | `balance_after - balance_before` (USDC actually received) |
| `get_balance(pool, asset, user)` | `balance(asset, user)` | The vault's current liquidity position |

`min_out` is forwarded to the pool for its own slippage check, and the realized
delta is re-checked locally by `require_min_out`, which panics with
`MinOutNotMet` when `min_out > 0` and the leg came up short.

#### Idle vs deployed tracking with DEX positions

DEX positions participate in the same idle/deployed split described under
[Idle vs Deployed Asset Tracking](#idle-vs-deployed-asset-tracking-issue-321):

- `get_idle_balance()` reads the vault's own USDC token balance and is
  protocol-agnostic — supplying liquidity moves value out of it.
- `get_deployed_assets()` dispatches on `CurrentProtocol`. When it is `"dex"`,
  the figure comes from a live `balance(asset, vault)` call on the configured
  DEX pool.
- If `CurrentProtocol` is `"dex"` but `DexPool` is unset, `get_deployed_assets()`
  returns `0` rather than panicking. The read path tolerates an unconfigured
  pool; the write path (`rebalance`) does not.
- `get_asset_breakdown()` returns both figures from a single invocation, so
  they cannot straddle a rebalance.

Because `get_deployed_assets()` performs a cross-contract call, it costs
materially more than a plain storage getter — roughly the same order as the
Blend balance read in the resource table above.

#### Rebalance flow for DEX deployments

`rebalance("dex", expected_apy, min_out)` runs the same sequence as the Blend
path:

1. Guards: agent auth, not paused, `0 ≤ expected_apy ≤ 10 000`, `min_out ≥ 0`,
   protocol in the `{"blend", "dex", "none"}` allowlist, and the rebalance
   cooldown (`MinRebalanceInterval`) has elapsed.
2. **Exit leg.** If `CurrentProtocol` is a different non-`"none"` protocol, the
   vault fully exits it first. If a non-zero balance remains after the
   withdrawal, `RebalanceFailedEvent` is emitted and the call **returns without
   further state changes** — the transaction is not reverted, so the failure is
   observable on-chain (Issue #145).
3. Panic with `DexPoolNotConfigured` if `DataKey::DexPool` is unset.
4. **Supply leg.** The entire idle USDC balance is supplied: the vault approves
   the pool for `amount` until `current_ledger + ApprovalTtl`, authorizes the
   nested `add_liquidity` → `transfer_from` invocation via
   `authorize_as_current_contract`, then calls the pool. `CurrentProtocol` is
   set to `"dex"` only when the realized amount is positive.
5. **Noop case.** With zero idle USDC and nothing moved, `CurrentProtocol` is
   still set to `"dex"` so tracking matches intent, and the rebalance reports
   status `"noop"` (mirrors Blend, Issue #146).
6. `RebalanceEvent` is emitted with status `"success"`, `"partial"` (realized
   below the attempted amount), `"failed"` (realized zero), or `"noop"`.

Withdrawals follow the reverse path: `withdraw_from_dex(amount, min_out)` pulls
from the pool when idle USDC cannot cover a redemption, treating `amount == 0`
as "withdraw the entire position".

#### DEX-specific events

| Event | Topic | Emitted by | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DexSupplyEvent` | `"dex_sup"` (`TOPIC_DEX_SUPPLY`) | supply leg of `rebalance("dex", ..)` | `asset`, `amount_actual` (balance-delta measured), `success` |
| `DexWithdrawEvent` | `"dex_wd"` (`TOPIC_DEX_WITHDRAW`) | DEX exit leg of `rebalance` or a user redemption | `asset`, `amount_actual`, `success` |
| `DexPoolConfiguredEvent` | `"dex_cfg"` (`TOPIC_DEX_POOL_CONFIGURED`) | `set_dex_pool` | `old_pool` (`None` on first configuration), `new_pool`, `owner` |

These are emitted **in addition to** the protocol-agnostic `RebalanceEvent` and
`ProtocolChangedEvent`. Indexers tracking which venue the vault is deployed to
should treat `ProtocolChangedEvent` as authoritative rather than inferring it
from supply/withdraw events. See [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) for full payload field
descriptions.

## Asset Flow Diagrams

### Deposit Flow

1. User authorizes deposit transaction.
2. USDC transferred from user to vault.
3. Vault calculates shares to mint based on current `TotalAssets` and `TotalShares`.
4. User share balance updated in persistent storage.
5. `TotalAssets` and `TotalShares` updated in instance storage.
6. `DepositEvent` emitted.

### Withdraw Flow

1. User authorizes withdrawal transaction.
2. Vault calculates shares to burn (rounding up to protect vault).
3. If vault balance is insufficient, funds are withdrawn from active protocols (e.g., Blend).
4. User share balance updated in persistent storage.
5. `TotalAssets` and `TotalShares` updated in instance storage.
6. USDC transferred from vault to user.
7. `WithdrawEvent` emitted.

### Rebalance Flow (AI Agent)

1. AI agent evaluates market conditions.
2. Agent calls `rebalance(protocol, expected_apy, min_out)` on vault.
3. Vault verifies caller is agent, protocol is in `{"blend", "dex", "none"}`,
   and the `MinRebalanceInterval` cooldown has elapsed.
4. If already deployed elsewhere, vault exits the current protocol first. An
   incomplete exit emits `RebalanceFailedEvent` and aborts without further
   state changes.
5. Vault executes on-chain movement (supply to or withdraw from Blend or the
   DEX pool), emitting the protocol-specific supply/withdraw event.
6. `ProtocolChangedEvent` emitted if `CurrentProtocol` changed.
7. `RebalanceEvent` emitted with the outcome status.

## Upgrade Model

### Storage Preservation

When upgrading the contract, the following storage keys must be preserved:

- `Shares(Address)` and `Balance(Address)`
- `TotalDeposits`, `TotalShares`, `TotalAssets`
- `Agent`, `UsdcToken`, `Owner`, `Paused`
- `TvLCap`, `UserDepositCap`, `ApprovalTtl`, `MinDeposit`, `MaxDeposit`
- `BlendPool`, `DexPool`, `CurrentProtocol`
- `UserStrategy(Address)`
- `MinRebalanceInterval`, `LastRebalanceLedger`
- `PendingAgent`, `AgentTimelockExpiry` (if an agent update is mid-flight)
- `Version` (incremented by `execute_upgrade`)

`PendingUpgradeHash` and `UpgradeTimelockExpiry` are deliberately **not**
preserved: `execute_upgrade` clears them before applying the new WASM, so the
upgraded contract starts with no proposal pending.

### Version History

| Version | Changes | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Initial 1:1 balance accounting (no shares) | Historical — superseded |
| 2 | ERC-4626 share accounting, Blend integration, rounding rules | **Current** |
| 3 | (Planned) Multi-asset support and advanced rebalancing | Future |

`Version` is incremented by `execute_upgrade`, not by `schedule_upgrade`.
Scheduling an upgrade that is later cancelled leaves `Version` untouched, so
`get_version()` always reflects the WASM actually running.

## Error Handling

Errors are surfaced as typed `VaultError` contract errors rather than raw panic
strings. See [ERROR_STYLE_GUIDE.md](ERROR_STYLE_GUIDE.md) for the full code
table and wording conventions.

### Key error codes by function

| Function | VaultError variant (code) | Condition |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| `initialize` | `AlreadyInitialized` (#4) | Called more than once |
| `deposit` | `Paused` (#35) | Vault is paused |
| `deposit` | `AmountMustBePositive` (#37) | amount ≤ 0 |
| `deposit` | `BelowMinimumDeposit` (#38) | amount < min_deposit |
| `deposit` | `ExceedsUserDepositCap` (#40) | user cumulative > cap |
| `deposit` | `ExceedsTvlCap` (#41) | total_assets + amount > tvl_cap |
| `withdraw` | `Paused` (#35) | Vault is paused |
| `withdraw` | `AmountMustBePositive` (#37) | amount ≤ 0 |
| `withdraw` | `InsufficientShares` (#8) | shares to burn > user shares |
| `rebalance` | `Paused` (#35) | Vault is paused |
| `unpause` | `NotPaused` (#21) | Called when not paused |

### Return Values

All read functions return the requested data or 0/default if not set.

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests

- Deposit with valid amount
- Deposit with minimum amount (boundary)
- Deposit exceeding cap (should fail)
- Withdraw with sufficient balance
- Withdraw exceeding balance (should fail)
- Pause/unpause by owner
- Pause by non-owner (should fail)

### Integration Tests

- Full deposit → rebalance → withdraw flow
- Multiple users depositing and withdrawing
- TVL cap enforcement
- User deposit cap enforcement
- Emergency pause during active deposits

## Gas Considerations

### Instance Storage Operations

- Read: ~1-2 gas units
- Write: ~2-3 gas units
- Use for: Configuration, totals, flags

### Persistent Storage Operations

- Read: ~1 gas unit
- Write: ~1-2 gas units
- Use for: User balances

### Optimization Strategies

1. Batch reads when possible
2. Use instance storage for frequently accessed globals
3. Use persistent storage for user-specific data

## Ledger Resource Baselines (Issue #203)

Measured in the Soroban simulator against `soroban-env-host 21.2.1` with the
MockBlendPool and TestToken test helpers.  Upper bounds used as soft regression
gates in `tests/test_budget.rs`.

| Operation | CPU instructions | Memory bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | < 5 000 000 | < 300 000 |
| `withdraw` (no Blend) | < 5 000 000 | < 300 000 |
| `withdraw` (Blend pull) | < 15 000 000 | < 600 000 |
| `rebalance → blend` | < 15 000 000 | < 600 000 |
| `rebalance → none` | < 15 000 000 | < 600 000 |

Cross-contract operations (Blend supply/withdraw) cost roughly 3× a simple
deposit because each `invoke_contract` carries its own CPU and memory overhead.

## Idle vs Deployed Asset Tracking (Issue #321)

The vault distinguishes between two components of its total managed value:

| Component | Getter | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Idle** | `get_idle_balance()` | USDC held directly in the vault contract, not yet deployed to any protocol. |
| **Deployed** | `get_deployed_assets()` | USDC currently supplied to an external yield protocol (e.g., Blend, DEX). |

Both values are also available in a single atomic call via `get_asset_breakdown()`, which returns `(idle, deployed)` — useful for dashboards and AI agents that need both figures without two separate RPC round-trips.

### How idle balance changes

- **Increases** on `deposit()` (user transfers USDC into the vault).
- **Decreases** on `rebalance()` when the agent supplies idle USDC to a protocol.
- **Increases** on `rebalance()` or `withdraw()` when funds are pulled back from a protocol.

### How deployed assets change

- **Increases** after a successful `rebalance()` into Blend or the DEX.
- **Decreases** after `rebalance()` to `"none"` (full protocol exit) or after
  partial/full protocol withdrawals triggered by user redemptions.
- Returns `0` when `CurrentProtocol` is `"none"` — no funds are deployed.

### Relationship to TotalAssets

`idle + deployed` may differ from `TotalAssets`.  `TotalAssets` is the
authoritative accounting value used for share pricing and includes accrued yield
as reported by the agent via `update_total_assets()`.  The live balance getters
query on-chain token balances directly and therefore represent the current
on-chain state before any yield reporting adjustment.

## TotalDeposits vs TotalAssets Relationship (Issues #183, #299)

Two separate values track vault accounting:

| Field | Updated by | Includes yield? | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TotalDeposits` | `deposit`, `withdraw` | No | Principal bookkeeping, reporting only |
| `TotalAssets` | `deposit`, `withdraw`, `update_total_assets` | Yes | Share pricing, TVL cap guard, all economic math |

**Design decision (issue #299):** `TotalDeposits` is intentionally *not* synced
when `update_total_assets()` is called.  It is a principal-only counter.
`TotalAssets` is the authoritative value for all economic calculations and cap
enforcement.

**TVL cap check uses `TotalAssets`**: after yield accrual `TotalAssets` can
exceed `TotalDeposits`.  The cap must compare against `TotalAssets` to prevent
additional deposits from pushing total managed value past the intended limit.
Checking `TotalDeposits` instead would allow over-subscription once yield has
grown the vault past the cap.

**Share pricing**: `share_price = TotalAssets / TotalShares`.  All economic
quantities (user balance, redemption amount) derive from `TotalAssets`, not
`TotalDeposits`.

**Regression tests**: `tests/test_total_assets_cap.rs` covers the full lifecycle:
deposit → yield accrual → withdrawal → cap check, confirming that `TotalAssets`
diverges from `TotalDeposits` after yield and that cap guards remain correct.

## expected_apy Validation (Issue #185)

`rebalance(protocol, expected_apy)` validates `0 ≤ expected_apy ≤ 10 000`
(basis points, where 10 000 = 100 %).  Values outside this range are rejected
with `vault: expected_apy out of range (0-10000 bps)`.

The field is **informational for indexers** — it is emitted in `RebalanceEvent`
but does not influence on-chain fund movement.  Off-chain consumers (AI agent,
dashboards) use it to audit that the expected yield reported at rebalance time
is plausible.

## Upgrade Safety (Issues #189, #316)

Contract upgrades are protected by two independent guards: a pause guard
(Issue #189) and a two-step timelock (Issue #316).

### Pause guard (Issue #189)

`schedule_upgrade()` and `execute_upgrade()` are both gated by
`require_not_paused()`. During an incident the operator pauses the vault to
freeze user operations; the upgrade guard ensures that a compromised or
mistaken WASM upgrade cannot be pushed while the vault is in a degraded state.
To upgrade: unpause → schedule → wait out the timelock → execute → re-pause if
needed.

`cancel_upgrade()` is deliberately **not** pause-gated, so the escape hatch
stays available even while the vault is paused.

### Two-step timelocked upgrade (Issue #316)

The instant `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` entrypoint has been removed. Replacing the
contract's WASM now requires two transactions separated by a mandatory delay,
which gives users and monitoring systems a window to observe a pending code
change and react to a malicious or mistaken proposal before it takes effect.

```
schedule_upgrade(owner, hash)          execute_upgrade(owner)
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
   [ pending ] ──── UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS ──▶ [ applied ]
        │              (17,280 ≈ 24 h)
        │
        └── cancel_upgrade(owner) ──▶ [ cleared ]
```

| Function | Auth | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule_upgrade(owner, new_wasm_hash)` | owner, not paused | Records `PendingUpgradeHash` and sets `UpgradeTimelockExpiry = current_ledger + UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS`. Emits `UpgradeScheduledEvent`. |
| `execute_upgrade(owner)` | owner, not paused | Requires `current_ledger >= UpgradeTimelockExpiry`. Clears both keys, applies the WASM, increments `Version`. Emits `UpgradedEvent`. |
| `cancel_upgrade(owner)` | owner | Clears both keys so a new proposal can be scheduled. Emits `UpgradeCancelledEvent`. |
| `get_pending_upgrade()` | none (read-only) | Returns `Some((wasm_hash, effective_ledger))` while a proposal is pending, else `None`. |

**Constant:** `UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS = 17_280` ledgers. At Stellar's ~5 s
per ledger that is ≈ 86,400 s = 24 hours. It matches `AGENT_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS`
so both privileged-role changes share one recovery window.

**Storage keys** (instance storage, both cleared on execute *and* on cancel):

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DataKey::PendingUpgradeHash` | `BytesN<32>` | WASM hash awaiting execution. Its presence is what makes an upgrade "pending". |
| `DataKey::UpgradeTimelockExpiry` | `u32` | First ledger sequence at which `execute_upgrade()` may be called. |

**Events:** `UpgradeScheduledEvent` (`"upg_sched"`), `UpgradeCancelledEvent`
(`"upg_cncl"`), and `UpgradedEvent` (`"upgraded"`, now emitted by
`execute_upgrade` rather than the removed instant path). See
[EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) for payload fields.

**Invariants:**

- Only one proposal may be pending at a time. Scheduling while
  `PendingUpgradeHash` exists panics with `TimelockAlreadyPending`; to change
  the target hash, cancel first and re-schedule (restarting the 24-hour clock).
- `execute_upgrade()` with no proposal panics with `NoTimelockPending`; before
  the expiry ledger it panics with `TimelockNotExpired`.
- `TimelockAlreadyPending`, `NoTimelockPending`, and `TimelockNotExpired` are
  shared with the agent timelock (Issue #317) because `#[contracterror]` caps
  the enum at 50 variants.
- The pending keys are cleared *before* `update_current_contract_wasm` is
  called, so a fresh proposal can always be scheduled after execution.
- A pending proposal has no effect on the running code. Until
  `execute_upgrade()` succeeds, the deployed WASM is unchanged.
