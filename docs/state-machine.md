## Per-State Description

### Active

Normal operating state. The vault accepts deposits and processes withdrawals.
Funds may be held directly in the vault or deployed via an external protocol
(Blend or a DEX). The share price is updated via `update_total_assets()`.

**Who can trigger entry:** `initialize()` (deployer), `unpause()` (owner).

**Preconditions:**
- `DataKey::Paused` is either absent or `false`.
- `DataKey::CurrentProtocol` may be `"blend"`, `"dex"`, or `"none"`.

**DEX sub-state:** When `CurrentProtocol == "dex"` the vault's USDC is
deployed to a configured DEX liquidity pool. Rebalancing to `"blend"` or
`"none"` exits the DEX position first (remove_liquidity), then enters the
target protocol. A failed DEX exit leaves `CurrentProtocol` unchanged.

**Blocked actions:** None — all user and admin operations available.

---

### Paused

The owner has halted normal operations. No deposits or withdrawals are processed.
Triggered by `pause()` (error code for unauthorized caller: `OnlyOwnerCanPause = 19`).

**Who can trigger entry:** Owner via `pause()`.

**Preconditions:** Vault must be in `Active` state.

**Blocked actions:**
- `deposit()` — reverts with `Error(Contract, #35)`
- `withdraw()` — reverts with `Error(Contract, #35)`
- `withdraw_all()` — reverts with `Error(Contract, #35)`

**Admin actions still allowed:** `unpause()`, `set_tvl_cap()`, `set_owner()`, `upgrade()`.

---

### Rebalancing

An implicit transient state during execution of `rebalance()`. The agent is moving
funds between protocols (e.g., Blend → Vault or Vault → DEX). There is no
explicit storage flag for this state; it is bounded by the single Soroban
transaction that runs `rebalance()`.

**Who can trigger entry:** Agent via `rebalance()`.

**Preconditions:**
- Vault must be in `Active` state (not paused).
- Current ledger ≥ `LastRebalanceLedger + MinRebalanceInterval` (cooldown enforced).

**Blocked actions:**
- None — Soroban's single-threaded execution model means no concurrent
  state mutation is possible during the transaction.

**Note:** Calling `rebalance()` before the cooldown period has elapsed is
rejected. The cooldown is tracked via `DataKey::LastRebalanceLedger` and
`DataKey::MinRebalanceInterval`.

---

### Emergency

A distinct pause mode triggered by `emergency_pause()` when the owner detects
an abnormal condition requiring immediate fund protection. Separate from the
regular `pause()` path; unauthorized callers receive
`OnlyOwnerCanEmergencyPause = 22`.

**Who can trigger entry:** Owner via `emergency_pause()`.

**Preconditions:** Vault is in `Active` or `Paused` state.

**Blocked actions:**
- `deposit()` — reverts with `Error(Contract, #35)`
- `withdraw()` — reverts with `Error(Contract, #35)`
- `withdraw_all()` — reverts with `Error(Contract, #35)`
- `rebalance()` — blocked while paused

**Resolution path:** Owner investigates the incident, applies any needed
remediation (off-chain or via upgrade), then calls `unpause()` to return
the vault to `Active`.

> **Implementation note:** Paused and Emergency states share the same on-chain
> storage flag (`DataKey::Paused = true`). Off-chain systems cannot distinguish
> between a regular pause and an emergency pause by inspecting storage alone —
> they must check emitted event topics (`"pause"` vs `"emergency_pause"`) to
> determine which path was taken.

---

### PendingAgentUpdate

A timelocked state triggered when the owner calls `update_agent()` to propose a new agent address. The new agent does not take effect immediately; instead, a proposal is recorded with an expiry ledger. This provides a recovery window during which the proposal can be cancelled if it was made in error or maliciously.

**Who can trigger entry:** Owner via `update_agent()`.

**Preconditions:**
- Vault must be in `Active` state (not paused).
- No pending agent update already exists (`DataKey::PendingAgentUpdateHash` absent).

**Blocked actions:**
- `update_agent()` — rejected with `TimelockAlreadyPending` (#48) while another proposal is active.
- `execute_agent_update()` — rejected with `TimelockNotElapsed` (#47) before the expiry ledger is reached.

**Valid during timelock:**
- Deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing continue normally — the vault remains operationally `Active`.
- `cancel_agent_update()` can be called by the owner at any time to clear the pending proposal.

**Exit paths:**
1. **Execute:** Once `ledger().sequence() >= AgentTimelockExpiry`, the agent calls `execute_agent_update()` to apply the new address. This clears the pending proposal and updates `DataKey::Agent`.
2. **Cancel:** The owner calls `cancel_agent_update()` at any time to abandon the proposal, clearing the pending storage keys.

**Storage keys:**
- `DataKey::PendingAgentUpdateHash` — the proposed new agent address.
- `DataKey::AgentTimelockExpiry` — the ledger sequence at which execution becomes allowed.

---

### PendingUpgrade

A timelocked state triggered when the owner calls `schedule_upgrade()` to propose a new WASM binary. Like the agent update, this defers the contract upgrade to provide a recovery window. This is the highest-stakes admin action as it replaces the contract's executable code.

**Who can trigger entry:** Owner via `schedule_upgrade()`.

**Preconditions:**
- Vault must be in `Active` state (not paused).
- No pending upgrade already exists (`DataKey::PendingUpgradeHash` absent).

**Blocked actions:**
- `schedule_upgrade()` — rejected with `TimelockAlreadyPending` (#48) while another proposal is active.
- `execute_upgrade()` — rejected with `TimelockNotElapsed` (#47) before the expiry ledger is reached.

**Valid during timelock:**
- Deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing continue normally — the vault remains operationally `Active`.
- `cancel_upgrade()` can be called by the owner at any time to clear the pending proposal.

**Exit paths:**
1. **Execute:** Once `ledger().sequence() >= UpgradeTimelockExpiry`, the owner calls `execute_upgrade()` to apply the new WASM. This clears the pending proposal and invokes Soroban's built-in upgrade mechanism.
2. **Cancel:** The owner calls `cancel_upgrade()` at any time to abandon the proposal, clearing the pending storage keys.

**Storage keys:**
- `DataKey::PendingUpgradeHash` — the hash of the proposed new WASM binary.
- `DataKey::UpgradeTimelockExpiry` — the ledger sequence at which execution becomes allowed.
